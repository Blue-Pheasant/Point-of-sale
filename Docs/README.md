# POINT OF SALE

This project is a web application developed using the PHP programming language and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern and use server-side rendering logic

The MVC architecture is a design pattern that separates the application into three interconnected components: 
- Model: represents the data and the business logic
- View: responsible for presenting the data to the client
- Controller: handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.

The choice of PHP as the programming language for this project is due to its popularity and wide usage in web development. PHP is a server-side scripting language that allows developers to create dynamic web pages and interact with databases. PHP is also easy to learn and use, making it a great choice for those starting to learn web development.

One of the special features of this project is that it **does not use any framework**. Instead, all the source code is **written in pure PHP**, making it a great opportunity for those who want to gain a deeper understanding of the language and its capabilities. This project is a useful tool for those starting to learn PHP from scratch and want to see how a real-world application can be built without relying on any frameworks.

This project was inspired by the Laravel framework, which is one of the most popular PHP frameworks used for web development. Laravel provides a lot of tools and features that make it easier to build web applications, but the goal of this project is to show how the same functionality can be achieved using only pure PHP. By understanding the underlying concepts and techniques used in this project, you will gain a solid foundation in PHP and be better prepared to work with more complex frameworks in the future.
